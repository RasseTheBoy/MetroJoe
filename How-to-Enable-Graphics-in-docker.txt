Open terminal (In jetson, not in docker image)
Type:

xhost local:root

Afterwards just run docker image in devcontainer and use as normal

(This is not a secure way to do it but it works)
X11 has been setup in the docker. rqt_graph and rviz2 are installed

Applications will open outside of docker in jetson but work as expected. (Probably).

TODO: Prune package install for future so we dont install a huge amount of stuff
TODO: Forward network settings to docker so we can connect it online
TODO: Check if X11 needs extra stuff to work in Windows enviroment (besides x11 server)

Random cool stuff i found:
